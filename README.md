# Projects for CSS Interns

<http://kzkaed.github.io/CSS-Interns/>

Each year, a group of 8th graders from Catherine Cook School are able to attend a day of software or design Apprenticeship at 8th Light.

A typical day introduces the students to software, design, executive and back office teams with a QA session with each of the teams.


### Highlights
- students join a software or design team for a daily standup or retrospective
- learn and experience the process and tools for software delivery and communication
- learn and experience a code and architecture review for the software system
- architect and implement individual projects with guidance from crafters
- participate in a conversation about a code base while mob or pair programming
- introduction to git (a fundamental collaborative versioning system)

  
Depending on the student interests a variety of student projects are available
 
_Introduction to HTML, CSS and JavaScript_ 
 
_Storyboarding Mobile Apps in Xcode with Swift_
 
_Imperative vs Function Programming Languages_
 
_Koans - Programming Puzzles in a variety of languages_

### Notes

An imperative language uses a sequence of statements to determine how to reach a certain goal. These statements are said to change the state of the program as each one is executed in turn.


The functional programming paradigm was explicitly created to support a pure functional approach to problem solving. Functional programming is a form of declarative programming.
